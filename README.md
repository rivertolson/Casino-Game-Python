# Casino-Game-Python

This is a simple simulation of a casino. The game it self will be very basic.
My plan with this project is to finish the game so it is at a state that I
am satisfied with and will run in the terminal. Then this project will split
into two: The first will be to add the game to a discord bot and the second
will be to continue game development.

These two projects could be done in any order. This is just a point in the
code where there will be a "fork in the road" and I may choose whichever
project I would like to continue with. The Discord bot could come first or
the full game development.

This initial project ends when I am satisfied with the game as it stands and
I see that the project could then grow into two separate ones. The threshold
will be met when I feel that there is no need, or practical use, to add any
more games or code that would not work in the discord bot. For example,
if I wanted to add something like a dart board, which would need a GUI, I
would not add that until I get to the game development project.

===== DISCORD BOT =====
I want to be able to create or use an API and create a database that will
allow for the game to store peoples information as they play the game. For
example a Discord user named Danny will be able to play the casino game within
Discord and the game will remember Danny's information. The Discord bot
should be able to store usernames, chips, and money count for each user
that may use it.

===== GAME DEVELOPMENT =====
Once I am satisfied with where I am with the original project, I will start
to make it a game project. I will add a GUI with graphics and animation. I
would like to be able to add sound to the game. The game will of course keep
all of the players information because that will be achieved with the initial
project. Additional games may be added to the casino and further development
may be reached with this project.
